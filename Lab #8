--1 Using Sports_Stats - write a query that returns all values
select *
from Sports_Stats



--2 Using Sport_Stats - write a query that only returns player_nm, team, pts_scored
select player_nm, team, Pts_Scored
from Sports_Stats


--3 Using the query from question 2, make Pts_Scored the first column in the results, 
--  also alias Player_nm as Player Name and Pts_scored as Points Scored
select 
Pts_Scored as [points Scored],
player_nm as [player name],
team
from Sports_Stats


--4 Using the query from question 3, add a where clause so that only the team the Reds 
--  return in the results
select 
Pts_Scored as [points Scored],
player_nm as [player name],
team
from Sports_Stats
where team = 'reds'

--5 Using the query from question 3, add a where clause so that only players whose names end 
--  with the letter e
select 
Pts_Scored as [points Scored],
player_nm as [player name],
team
from Sports_Stats
where Player_Nm like '%e'

--6  Change Query below to a Full Outer Join

Select *
from Student as s
full join Tutoring as t
on s.Stud_ID = t.Student_ID;

--7 Debug the query below

Select *
from Tutor as t
join tutoring as t1
on t.Tutor_ID = t1.tutor_ID;


--8 Fix the query below so that it only returns the following Fields: Stud_NM, Tutor_ID, Subject

Select s.Stud_NM, t.Tutor_ID, t.Subject
from Student as s
join Tutoring as t
on s.Stud_ID = t.Student_ID;

--9  Fix query below (hint: Tutor_ID is a field in both tables)

Select t.Tutor_ID, Name, YearService, Subject
from Tutor as t
join tutoring as t1
on t.Tutor_ID = t1.tutor_ID;

--10  Fix the query below so no NULLs show

Select  t.Name, t.YearService, t1.Subject
from Tutor as t
left join tutoring as t1
on t.Tutor_ID = t1.tutor_ID
where subject is not NULL

---- Bonus Questions ----


-- using this case statement as a template. Create one that puts the pts_scored column
-- from the Sports_Stats table into 3 categories - High Score, Med Score, Low Score
  select *,
  case 
  when Price < 100 then 'Low Cost'
  when Price < 500 then 'Mid Cost'
  when Price < 1000 then 'High Cost'
  else'Expensive'
  end as Cost_bucket
  from Cust_Orders

  select *,
  case
  when Pts_Scored < 10 then 'low'
  when Pts_Scored < 20 then 'mid'
  else 'high'
  end as points_bucket
  from Sports_Stats


  --- Using the case statement you created in the previous step. Put the query into
  --- a temp table (remember # indicates temp table)

  select *,
  case
  when Pts_Scored < 10 then 'low'
  when Pts_Scored < 20 then 'mid'
  else 'high'
  end as points_bucket
  into #ptsBuck
  from Sports_Stats




  --- Query your temp table filtering for Low Score

  select *
  from #ptsBuck
  where points_bucket = 'low'
